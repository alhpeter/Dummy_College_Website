                        Aeronautical Engineering is one of the fascinating areas in Engineering across the globe. Aeronautical Engineering is the science involved with the study, design, and manufacture of flight-capable machines, or the techniques of operating aircraft. This course trains an engineer in designing, constructing, analyzing and testing of commercial or military aircrafts, missiles, and spacecraft. The Aerospace & Defense technology enhances the nation’s technology target and achieves global recognition.

                        The department of Aeronautical Engineering was established in 2019, affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University. The department has grown rapidly ever since its establishment. The goal of the department is to mentor the students into top-class aeronautical engineers, suitable for employment in the National and International scenarios and almost catering successful engineers into various aerospace organizations continuously. The Department offers a vibrant academic atmosphere that enables independent research and the free exchange of ideas among students and faculties. The department has continuous interaction with Aerospace and Defense organizations of international reputation like Dassault Systems, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Aeronautical Society of India and National Aerospace Laboratories to help students build the required skill set.
